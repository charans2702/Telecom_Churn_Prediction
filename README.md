## Overview

Customer churn is a significant issue in the telecom industry, where customers frequently switch service providers. Predicting churn can help telecom companies identify high-risk customers and develop strategies to improve customer retention. In this project, a Random Forest classifier is used to predict churn based on various customer features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as:
- Customer demographics 
- Subscription details 
- Account Details
- Contract details

The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle. It typically contains features and a target variable (`Churn`) indicating whether the customer has churned.
