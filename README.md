#Overview
Customer churn is a significant issue in the telecom industry, where customers frequently switch service providers. Predicting churn can help telecom companies identify high-risk customers and develop strategies to improve customer retention. In this project, a Random Forest classifier is used to predict churn based on various customer features.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as:

1.Customer demographics 
2.Account Details
3.Subscription details (tenure, service type, etc.)
4.Contract details (monthly charges, total charges, etc.)

The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle. It typically contains features and a target variable (Churn) indicating whether the customer has churned.
